From supervisor

As an introductory reading, let me suggest this book by
Dr. Veronika Brázdová, Dr. David R. Bowler
"Atomistic Computer Simulations: A Practical Guide"
available electronically through KTH library.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9783527671816
It introduces some useful concepts of atomistic modeling (maybe too many) in a light form.
(chapters 1-11 with focus on 11.3 about surfaces and interfaces)

More fundamental and rigorous textbooks are also available from the library, so if you feel you want to dig into some subjects more deeply, this book may be recommended:
G. Grosso, G. Pastori Parravicini
"Solid State Physics: Second Edition"
https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123044600/solid-state-physics
(chapters 1-6)
